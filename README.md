# Air Quality Index Prediction 🌍✨

## Project Overview
This project predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning techniques. AQI is a critical metric used worldwide to assess air pollution and its effects on human health. This repository demonstrates how to preprocess AQI datasets, engineer meaningful features, and build predictive models like **SVM** and **Logistic Regression** for accurate AQI predictions.

## Features 🛠️
- Comprehensive **data preprocessing**, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
- **Feature engineering** to improve model performance.
- Implementation of **machine learning algorithms**:
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
  - **Logistic Regression**
- Clear visualization of results using **Matplotlib** and **Pandas**.
